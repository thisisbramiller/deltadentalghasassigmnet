# This GitHub Actions workflow file is used to run CodeQL analysis on a repository. It consists of two jobs: "find-paths-with-changes" and "scan".

# The "find-paths-with-changes" job is responsible for finding the paths that have changed in the repository. It runs on the "ubuntu-latest" environment and has the following steps:
# 1. Checkout repository: This step checks out the repository code.
# 2. Get all paths: This step retrieves all the paths in the repository if the event is not a pull request.
# 3. Get changed paths: This step retrieves the paths that have changed in the repository if the event is a pull request.
# 4. Set matrix values: This step sets the matrix values for the "scan" job based on the retrieved paths.

# The "scan" job is responsible for analyzing the repository with CodeQL. It runs on the "ubuntu-latest" environment and has the following steps:
# 1. Checkout repository: This step checks out the repository code.
# 2. Generate CodeQL config file: This step generates the CodeQL configuration file based on the target directory.
# 3. Initialize CodeQL: This step initializes CodeQL with the specified configuration and languages.
# 4. Attempting Autobuild: This step attempts to autobuild the code if the languages are "cpp" or "csharp".
# 5. Install Java: This step installs Java if the language is "java-kotlin".
# 6. Build project: This step builds the Java project if the language is "java-kotlin".
# 7. Analyze with CodeQL: This step analyzes the repository with CodeQL using the specified matrix values.

# The workflow is triggered on push events to the "main" branch and pull request events targeting the "main" branch. It ignores changes to the README.md file and any other files.
